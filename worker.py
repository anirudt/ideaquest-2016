FORMAT of the "People" Database

The people's database has the self location and the list of friends, hashable by contact no.

The database needs to be consistent, i.e. there should be
an entry for every friend of yours, even if we have or do
not have his/her location/data.

        'location': (0, 0),

FORMAT of the "Reviews" Database

The reviews database has the self location and list of reviews, hashable by location.

reviews = {}

        '1111111111' : ["This is a great place", 200]
}
The members of the list are the review and the timestamp respectively.
